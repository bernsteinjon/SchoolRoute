SchoolRoute

The main problem we are trying to address through the development of SchoolRoute is chronic absenteeism in Trenton Public Schools. There are a variety of issues that contribute to the attendance problem that exists within Trenton schools, ranging from parents not wanting other people to be responsible for their kids to unsafe routes for students to walk to school. We plan to address these issues by developing an application that encourages open communication between parents and volunteers, as well as encouraging students to walk to school on “safe corridors”. These safe corridors would be approved by the school, and would be a collection of the safest streets for students to walk on.

Our main objective through the development of SchoolRoute is to get students in school, every day. We believe that consistent attendance is an integral and overlooked aspect of this issue. While getting students to school more often is achievable, we believe we can design a system that encourages students to be in school every day. We believe that by combatting attendance issues in their earliest stages, we can make a difference in the number of students that are able to graduate by their expected graduation date. We aim to address this issue by incentivizing members of the Trenton Public School system, through some reward system, to use our system to ensure that their students are showing up at school every day.
