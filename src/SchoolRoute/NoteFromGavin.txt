Yo yo yo. Login system has been kind of implemented. Right now, different
users do not have different permissions. They will hopefully have them 
eventually. For the time being, if you want to try it out, launch the site,
and go to csc415-f19-team02.hpc.tcnj.edu:3000/users to register an account.
Go to /login to try logging in with one of the accounts. There is some
semblance of session management but it doesn't really fully work yet. Will
work on this in a bit.
